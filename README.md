# Get ontop of your Salat with SalatCal! 📅
SalatCal is an iOS calendar subscription that will highlight the times of Prayers in the day!
You dont need to do anything apart from the setup (which is really simple), leave the rest to us.

## 📦 Setup
The first thing to do is find your city in the Supported Cities section of this readme file. 
You will see on the right hand side of the city name a query param. It looks like this ```?city=CityName``` <br> <br>
Grab that and append it at the end of this url: <br>
```https://moeyplayground.azurewebsites.net/api/salat.ics``` <br> <br>
The full thing should look something like this: <br>
```https://moeyplayground.azurewebsites.net/api/salat.ics?city=Sydney```
<br>
