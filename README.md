# Get ontop of your Salat with SalatCal! 📅🤲
Its understandle that life happens and we are all busy, but thats not an excuse to miss your prayers!!<br>
The aim of SalatCal is help remind you of your prayers so that you can stucture your days better and inshallah pray on time <br>
SalatCal is an <b>iOS</b> calendar subscription that will make each prayer an event in your Calendar app with the accurate prayer times!<br>
You wont even need to ever search the web or lookup that calendar on your fridge for the prayer time, it will be spoon fed to you in the Calender <br>
You dont need to do anything apart from the setup (which is really simple), leave the rest to us.

## 📦 Setup
<b> Step 1: </b>
Find your city in the Supported Cities section of this readme file. 
You will see on the right hand side of the city name a query param. It looks like this ```?city=CityName``` 
<br>
<br>

<b> Step 2: </b>
Grab that and append it at the end of this url: <br>
```https://moeyplayground.azurewebsites.net/api/salat.ics``` <br> <br>
The full thing should look something like this: <br>
```https://moeyplayground.azurewebsites.net/api/salat.ics?city=Sydney```
<br>
<br>

<b> Step 3: </b>
Add the Calendar to your device:
